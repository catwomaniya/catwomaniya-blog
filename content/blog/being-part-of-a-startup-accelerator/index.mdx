### Startup accelerators - What are they ?

Startup accelerators are organizations that have connections to investors, ex-founders, business partnerships, and capital. They run fixed-term, cohort-based programs for the most promising startups.

The aim is to quickly equip companies with everything they need to scale. This includes providing seminars, investor pitches, and help fine-tuning the product and business model.

In exchange for a short (3-6 month) program and chunk of startup capital, accelerators often take a slice of equity, usually ranging from 5% to 10%. Others don’t take equity or may provide less initial capital.

The amount of capital or the intensity of the program is often seen as a differentiator between accelerator programs and incubators. Incubators are geared to help very early stage startups, often in an idea or testing phase; maybe getting their first few clients. Whereas an accelerator provides the resources to help that small startup grow into one which has proof-of-concept, market validation, and an understanding of what it should do next.

### Which areas get the most funding?

It’ll come as no surprise that all 11 of the highest-growth verticals (by funding) are technology companies.

Between 2012 and 2017, robotics, blockchain and agtech each grew by over 1,000%. The next biggest three verticals were AI, fintech, and cybersecurity. This reflects the high-tech future we’re headed towards:
