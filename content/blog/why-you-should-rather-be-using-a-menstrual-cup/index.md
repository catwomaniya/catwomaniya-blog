**FYI - This post is a tad bit different from my previous posts and is proportionately biased by my personal experiences, and many TMI alerts, because I will get into graphic details.**

I have been waiting to write about this since the beginning of this year, and my time has come.

Having only used plain ol’ sanitary napkins, my next go-to move was to try tampons. Of course, this decision only materialized a year ago, when I was on a trip that involved getting wet/being in water and I didn’t want something this trivial to “wash” over all my plans. Out of the need for better leakage-control, and after being vetted by many,many of my girlfriends, I took the plunge and got some tampons. My worries of leakage, stains, rashes, disposal subsided. 

A girl was happy.

Fast forward to January 2020, and I decided to self-check and analyse my life’s activities with sustainability and zero waste at the crux of it. Now of course, I was going to look into menstrual waste generated through single-use pads and tampons and find ways to reduce my output.

Honestly, I heard about Menstrual Cups for the first time, probably some 3-4 years ago, and the very fact of putting some alien object inside me, made me shudder. More so, the fact that one had to reuse the same cup multiple times, seemed extremely unhygienic to me. (It’s really not)

### Why use a menstrual cup

Keeping aside the fact that a person uses (more specifically, myself) 10 sanitary pads in a month, which becomes 120 pads in a year, which can potentially lead to using 4560 pads in their lifetime.

</p>

Naturally, I decided to find a solution. A quick 2 hour web search told me all about the various sanitary products, and after some discussions on online forums like Reddit, which also involved a detailed comparison of biodegradable pads Vs Menstrual cups, I made my decision. 

FYI, Biodegradable pads are great, well almost, because they need to be segregated and personally composted in a separating compost pit, so that they can actually go back to earth.

### How menstrual waste is treated currently

If you guessed, landfills, you’re absolutely correct!
Only two cities in India — Bengaluru and Pune — implement solid waste interventions to effectively segregate and identify menstrual waste during routine garbage collection.
Anyway, it still goes through some small scale incineration or burying for disposal.

### My experience with it 
I read many articles/reviews and watched thousands of YouTube videos that reviewed the product, gave tips on insertion/removal, hygiene tips etc. before actually committing to the product.

I bought this - [Sirona Reusable Menstrual Cup for Women - Medium Size](https://www.amazon.in/Sirona-Approved-Reusable-Menstrual-Silicone/dp/B07548J9WC/ref=pd_lpo_121_t_0/259-8192318-0440851?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B07548J9WC&pd_rd_r=d68b39f7-8abc-4229-8bf4-aa368625d22d&pd_rd_w=fo244&pd_rd_wg=egqhS&pf_rd_p=5a903e39-3cff-40f0-9a69-33552e242181&pf_rd_r=KYTABYFRHBEJC7Z5V39E&psc=1&refRID=KYTABYFRHBEJC7Z5V39E&smid=AT95IG9ONZD7S) from Amazon, because it had more reviews and a good amount of 4-star reviews. 

#### Step 1 : Unboxing

So the box I received was not in a great state, which may be due to the fact that it spent 5 days outside, to quarantine it. But the actual cup was vacuum sealed in plastic, so it was all okay inside.

#### Step 2 : Sanitization

One has to sanitize the cup before using it for the first time, by boiling it in plain water for 10 minutes or so.

The cup needs to be folded before inserting it, and there are various techniques for it.

(I personally like the punchdown folding method)

#### Step 3 : Insertion

**#TMI**
I remember that dance I did in the bathroom when I tried to use a tampon for the first time. I thought it would be something like that. 

It wasn’t. 

It took some 20-30 minutes to figure it out the first time. But I had patience and a handy knowledge of positions/tricks to experiment with.
Knowing how to relax your pelvic muscles is a must. I found squatting was the best position, where I could use both my hands to insert it - one to part the labia and the other to put the cup and push it inside (Rim should be facing up)

Once it’s inside a suction will be created, and I normally walk/run/glide/jump a bit to ensure that it’s firmly in place.

Quite honestly, it didn’t feel like anything. I have used tampons before and I have been aware of their presence while using them, but this was new, in a good way.

#### Step 4 : Removal

**#TMI** 
Of course, the fear of being unable to remove the cup was always there. 

After 10 hours, when I went to the bathroom to remove the cup, I couldn’t feel the tip/stem of the cup so I was scared, and fully dreading the scenario of going to a hospital to get it removed, even though I knew that’s an unlikely scenario.

<p align="center">
    <img src = "./40.jpg" alt ="Panik man" >
</p>

So, of course, I used my pelvic muscles to push it out, until I could feel the tip. Again using two hands here - one was to hold the tip in place so it doesn’t get sucked back in again, the other hand was used to get a finger inside, in between the rim of the cup and the vaginal wall, to break suction. I did this in the shower area, for chances of spillage. I will be honest, it wasn’t the most comfortable experience, but after repeated use I did get a hang of it.

If you try removing it like a tampon, and yank it out, It will definitely hurt you. Break the seal first.

And there it was, hardly some 5 mL of menstrual blood. I honestly believed I bled a lot, by looking at the after-state of my sanitary pads, but that’s not true.

This blood was then flushed down the toilet and cleaned with running water, for further use.

#### Step 5 : Final Wash and Storage

Yay. Periods are over!
I washed it in boiling water on the last day and kept it in a cloth bag, which came along with the cup. It’s important to ensure that this bag is next kept in a clean and dry place, until the next month.


One also needs to keep in mind to wash their hands with soap before and after using it.

### Advantage of using a menstrual cup

<p align="center">

</p>

-  *Less landfill waste* - It’s a super eco-friendly menstrual product. One cup can be used for some 10 years which is the equivalent of using 1800 pads
- *Low cost* - The cup that I bought costs INR 300. The pads that I used previously had an average cost of INR 10 per pad. Assuming, the lifetime of the cup is 10 years and not taking into account any external factors, the cup is saving me some INR 11700 (12000-300)
- *More time between changes* - Now, this may vary from person to person but the number of times I have to change the cup Vs pad, is on the lower side.
- *Super comfy* - It is much more comfortable than pads. I cannot emphasize this enough, I didn’t feel its presence at all. On the bad side, you may actually forget it and leave it inside for a longer time.
- *Can work out with it* - I went for a jog, did yoga, did a basic calisthenics workout while using the cup, and it didn’t feel any different. Using pads while exercising was a painful task, because it led to skin bruising on the inner thighs.
- *Feels more hygienic* - Pads always keep touching you, they lead to rashes, abrasions, whatnot. And don’t even get me started on the odor, which keeps reminding you throughout the day that you’re wearing a pad. Cups on the other hand, don’t release any odors because the fluid doesn’t get exposed to the air.

Don’t want to read that graphic description? I got you. Adding a FAQ sort-of section below which is more informational

**Are menstrual cups safe**

They’re super safe. Unless you’re allergic to silicone. 

**How does a menstrual cup work**

Just like a tampon, it is inserted into your vagina, but instead of absorbing your flow, like a tampon or pad, it catches and collects it.

**What are they made of**

They can be made of medical-grade silicone, rubber or latex. 
They do not contain any chemicals, as compared to pads and tampons, which may contain bleach and dioxin. (Some dioxins can cause cancer)

**What is the price of a menstrual cup**

It can fall in the range of INR 250 - 1000.
It's cheaper in the long run.

**What factors should you consider while buying a cup**

Size - There is no standard sizing chart but brands provide sizes based on flow and cervix position.
Color - Opting for a darker color is my go to thought, since it won’t have that wear-down look after multiple uses.

**How to put in a menstrual cup**

There are many folding techniques you can try to find what works for you. Here is a [list](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnK8J8fQxk)

**How to clean a menstrual cup**

Warm water and mild soap will do the job just right.
Definitely clean out the suction holes, which are present near the rim. They help in releasing the suction, when you need to remove it.
If you want to remove stains, some scrubbing and a vinegar solution will come in handy

**How to remove a menstrual cup**

The most important thing to do here is relax your muscles and use both hands.
Hold onto the stem of the cup with one hand and use the other hand to insert one finger between the rim and vaginal wall, to let air inside, after which the cup can be pulled outside in the standing position, to avoid leakage.

A BBC post said that you shouldn't be pushing your pelvic muscles as it can lead to pelvic organ prolapse, which may happen to people who have a higher cervix, so instead get in a deep squat, breathe with an open mouth and pinch down the base or body of cup to break seal.

**Can a cup get stuck inside your body**

Your vaginal canal is actually pretty narrow with a comforting dead end at your cervix. It literally cannot be swallowed up by your body.

**How to respond to nature calls with a cup inside**

It’s no biggie. The cup is inside the vagina and pee comes out of the urethra - different holes. 
Same thing for pooping. There may be some pressure that causes the cup to shift, so a check may be necessary after doing the deed.

**How often should you remove it**

It can be left on for upto 12 hours, and works well for heavy flow days.

**Is there any leakage**

Not at all. 
Definitely look out for the ‘pop’ sound to ensure the cup is sealed well. If not, the cup isn’t fitted perfectly.

**Is it painful to insert/remove**

Honestly, the first few trials are difficult. But practice makes it perfect.

**Can a virgin use the cup / Will it break their hymen**

Yes, it can. So can a lot of things like riding a bike.
