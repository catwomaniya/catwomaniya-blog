Mastering SEO optimization can be hard, especially if you’re just starting out. I started learning SEO and optimizing my website sometime in August, and I scourged SEO master blogs, reddit communities to come up with a list of free tools to get some hands-on experience and to also judge what works and what doesn’t.

So I tried and tested the tools and then grouped them by categories. Personally, as a beginner, I do not believe you will be needing the odd 100 SEO tools of wildly varying quality, I see mentioned in comprehensive blog posts, I feel like 100 SEO tools is a ridiculous amount to process as a user. You will just need two or three really good tools to run an SEO experiment (I will write a detailed article on how to run an SEO experiment in a different article)

I am sharing the best SEO tools that are free but you will probably need to create account/login to access most of them

### Keyword Research

I am a big proponent of using multiple keyword tools and using them synergistically. I do not believe in using just one tool, as together they help me generate content that I need.

1. [Keyword Tool](https://keywordtool.io/) -
This is great for discovering variations of keywords to build pages around. Frequently, I use this the most for developing content.

2. [Keywords Everywhere](https://keywordseverywhere.com/) -
The good thing is you won't have to spend time searching and copying data from different sites, which is huge. You can also download your metrics as a PDF or Excel document for data storage.

3. [SEMRush](https://www.semrush.com/features/keyword-research/) -
Pretty useful for generating competitive insights, even at domain-level.

### On-page SEO

1. [Merkle’s Schema Markup Generator](https://technicalseo.com/tools/schema-markup-generator/) -
Luckily, one can implement structured data on your website at no cost (and with little technical know-how). 

2. [Ahrefs’ SEO Toolbar](https://ahrefs.com/seo-toolbar) -
It generates an on-page SEO report for the visited page with important elements. [read](https://ahrefs.com/blog/ahrefs-seo-toolbar-whats-new/)

### Link Building

1. [Ahrefs’ Backlink Checker](https://ahrefs.com/backlink-checker) - 
It shows the top 100 backlinks to any website or web page for free.

2. [SEMRush Link Building](https://www.semrush.com/link_building/) -
Can help anyone to find and acquire the highest quality relevant backlinks. 

### Technical SEO

1. [Screaming Frog](https://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/seo-spider/) -
Screaming Frog is a great SEO tool. Their free version offers a lot of great insights about specific sites and seeing what H1, H2 tags, Alt Tags, Meta Descriptions and more.

2. [Lighthouse Chrome plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk?hl=en) - 
The most useful part of the tool is the number of technical issues and actions it highlights.

### Analytics
[Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/) -
There is no other data source that provides high quality and detailed information like Google Analytics, this is a must.
